# hello-world
This is a repository for materials associated with a Coursera Course on learning version control and interfacing with R.
The guide, which is located at: https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/, has some text about getting tacos on the moon and that they found them superior to the tacos on the Earth.  I will just have to take their word for it.
